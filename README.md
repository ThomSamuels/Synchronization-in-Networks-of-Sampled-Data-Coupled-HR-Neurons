# Synchronization-in-Networks-of-Sampled-Data-Coupled-HR-Neurons
MATLAB code to determine the (partial) synchronization regions for networks of sampled-data coupled HR neurons

The MATLAB function, compute_manifolds.m, for the computation of partial synchronization manifolds for delay-coupled systems by Wim Michiels et al,
that is needed to run Synchronizatin.m, can be downloaded from http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-control/manifolds/.
